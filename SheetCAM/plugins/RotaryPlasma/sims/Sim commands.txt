    CL = create LED (caption)
    CT = create text box (caption)
    CN = create number box (caption units) see below for the units values
    DC = draw controls (call this after creating them with the above commands)

    SL = Set LED (index,value) value =0 is off, any other value = on
    ST = set text(index,text)
    SN = set number(index,value)
 in the above cases index starts at 1, not 0. The first item created is 1 then second 2 and so on

    RM = rapid move (x y z a)
    MV = move (x y z a)
    AR = arc (x y z a) x,y,z = centre a = arc angle

    FR = set feed rate
    RR = set rapid rate
    TD = set tool diameter

    SX = Set X position
    SY = Set Y position
    SZ = Set Z position

    OP = select operation(n) n=operation index, starting at 0
    PT = select part(n) n=part index, starting at 0
